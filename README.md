## 📊 Project Objective

The objective of this analysis is to provide actionable insights for Airbnb stakeholders by answering the following business questions:

- Which cities have the least favorable location scores?
- How does **host experience** (in years) impact trustworthiness?
- What are the most expensive **property types** for "Entire place" listings?
- Which cities score highest on **guest satisfaction** (communication + check-in)?
- How do **average prices vary across cities**?

1. **Listings.csv** – Contains property-level details such as price, room type, location, host_since, etc.
